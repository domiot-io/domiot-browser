# BDCOM Security Whitelist - Allowed Driver Paths
# 
# This file defines which driver paths are allowed for BDCOM communication.
# Each line represents a pattern that will be matched against driver locations.
# 
# Supported patterns:
#   - Exact match: /dev/ihubx24-sim0
#   - Prefix match: /dev/ihubx24-sim*
#   - Suffix match: *sim0
#   - Contains match: /dev/*sim* , /dev*-sim* , */tmp/*sim* , etc.
#   - Allow all: *
#
# Examples:
#   - /dev*-sim* matches: /dev/board-sim0, /devtest-sim1, /dev/custom-sim-device
#   - *sim*x24 matches: /dev/test-sim-ihubx24, /sim-ohubx24
#   - /dev/*/sim* matches: /dev/test/sim0, /dev/board/sim-device
#
# Lines starting with # are comments and will be ignored.
# Empty lines are also ignored.

# Allow all simulation drivers
/dev*-sim*

# Alternative: If you want to be more restrictive during development,
# uncomment specific patterns below and comment out the * above:

# /dev/ihubx24-sim*
# /dev/ohubx24-sim*  
# /dev/iohubx24-sim*
# /dev/phidgetvintx60*
# /dev/display-sim*
# /dev/lock-sim*
# /tmp/*
# /home/*/dev/* 

# Allow specific Phidget devices
/dev/phidgetvintx60*

# Allow all paths (development only!)
# *
